<h2> Typical message </h2>

<pre>
 fatal error #16000: object files have incompatible formats
   ("/db/lang/msp/exec/rts430_eabi.lib<boot.obj>" = ELF, "example.obj" =
   TI-COFF)
</pre>

<h2> What it means </h2>

<p>The linker has been supplied with object files or libraries that were compiled with different, incompatible object file formats.</p>

<h2> Why is it happening </h2>

<p>The linker can only combine object files and libraries of a single object file format, but files of multiple object file formats were specified.  The object file format is controlled by the application-binary interface (ABI), so ultimately files were compiled with a different --abi option.  Since the object files for your project are compiled according to the build options this is usually an issue with using a library file built for a different ABI.</p>

<h2> Remedy </h2>

<p>Make sure all of the pre-built object and library files are built for the ABI that you are using.  You can verify the ABI being used by looking at the --abi option in the build options dialog.  If you are explicitly specifying the RTS library to be used through the --library option you can remove it -- the linker will automatically include the correct RTS library.  If you are using additional libraries provided by TI or 3rd parties please confirm that they are for the correct ABI.</p>

<h2> Risks, Severity </h2>

<p>An executable cannot be created until this error is resolved.</p>
