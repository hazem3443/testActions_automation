 error #10198-D: no input section is linked in

    <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="What_it_means"> What it means </span></h2>
    <p>The linker has not found any &#8220;referenced&#8221; input sections to

    <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Why_is_it_happening"> Why is it
        happening </span></h2>
    <p>A likely scenario for this message to appear is if you are
      building an ELF project with only assembly source files that do
      not have any "referenced" sections. This is a fundamental
      difference between COFF and ELF. COFF retains all sections by
      default. The opposite is true for ELF. In ELF, all sections are
      eligible for removal via conditional linking meaning that they
      will be removed if they are not referenced. If a section needs to
      be retained, the user must make sure that they are explicitly
      retained.
    </p>
    <p>This would not be an issue with most C projects, as there is an
      entry point (defined by the C runtime library) which in turn calls
      main, and so sections will be pulled into the link. In the case of
      a single assembly source file, this is not the case.
    </p>

      This page was written for the C6000 tools but how the ELF/EABI
      feature works is the same for other devices as well.

    <h2> <span class="mw-headline" id="Remedy"> Remedy </span></h2>
    <p>To work around this bug, add <span style="color: red">below two
        directives</span> to the assembly source file.<br>
      - .retain tells the linker to keep this section (.text)<br>
      - .retainrefs additionally tells the linker to retain sections
      that reference this.<br>
