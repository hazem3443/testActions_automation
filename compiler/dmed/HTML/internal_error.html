<h2> What it means </h2>

<p>The compiler has detected that something drastic is wrong.</p>

<h2> Why it is happening </h2>

<p>This almost always indicates a bug exists in the compiler.</p>

<h2> Remedy </h2>

<p>There is usually nothing the user can do about it.</p>

<p>This bug was so unexpected, Texas Instruments cannot offer any suggestions for working around the bug without a test case.</p>

<p>Create a reproducible test case (including source code, header files, command line options, and compiler version) and <a href="http://e2e.ti.com/support/development_tools/compiler/f/343.aspx">submit it to Texas Instruments</a> for analysis.</p>

<h2> Risks, Severity </h2>

<p>There is a bug in the compiler.  If Texas Instruments is not made aware of the bug, it cannot be fixed.</p>
